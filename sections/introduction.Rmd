\section{Introduction}

Salary disparities remain a persistent issue, reflecting deeper societal 
inequalities. Despite governmental efforts, the wage gap continues, 
underscoring the need for ongoing research to understand and address these 
disparities effectively.

This study leverages comprehensive data from the 1996 U.S. Census to provide 
a multi-dimensional analysis of how various factors collectively influence 
salary differences. Our primary goal is to identify key variables that predict
whether an individual earns more or less than $50,000. This approach allows for
a thorough exploration of the dataset, enabling a nuanced understanding of the 
different factors driving income disparity.

The theoretical implications of this research are significant, enhancing 
sociological theories related to wage inequality. Practically, the findings 
could help promote greater equality among the population. By clarifying the 
factors that exacerbate income disparities, this research assists in shaping 
interventions that policymakers could implement to foster a more equitable 
labor market.
