\section{Introduction}

An introduction should answer these questions in a few pages:

Why is this problem important?

How does this study relate to previous work in the area?

What are the primary and secondary hypotheses and objectives of the study?

How do the hypotheses and research design relate to one another?

What are the theoretical and practical implications of the study?

This section should not get a primary heading (i.e., "Introduction"), you simply re-write the
title at the top
