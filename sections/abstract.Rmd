# Abstract

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in developed countries,
and 12% of breast cancer occurs in women 20-34 
yearscite[@Hickey09:bc].

Advancements in prediction and diagnosis are crucial for maintaining a healthy 
life. Accurate cancer prediction mechanisms are vital for improving patient 
treatment and survival rates. Predictive techniques play a significant role 
in the early diagnosis of breast cancer, allowing for timely intervention
and better management of the disease. In this study, we focus on enhancing the
accuracy of breast cancer predictions by employing advanced data analysis 
techniques. Specifically, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to 
reduce the dataset's dimensionality. This step is essential as it helps to 
simplify the dataset, making the predictive model more efficient and effective. 
By reducing the number of variables, we can focus on the most significant 
features that contribute to accurate predictions, thus improving the model's
overall performance.

Additionally, we applied Logistic Regression to perform the prediction of the
binary outcome (presence or absence of breast cancer). Logistic Regression 
is well-suited for this task as it provides a clear probabilistic framework
for binary classification problems. The dataset used for this analysis is the
Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) datasetparencite[@UCI95:bc], 
a well-known dataset in the field of medical diagnostics. We conducted our
analysis and reporting using _R Studio, specifically version 4.3.2, 
released on October 31, 2023_.
