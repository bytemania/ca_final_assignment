\section{Abstract}

What is the study all about (in no more than about 150-250 words). Abstracts provide a reader with the most
important details. Ideally, the abstract enables the reader to decide whether he or she should read the article.
Again, never promise more than can be given. Not everyone is going to be interested in the work; but that
does not mean the writer should not point out some of the most intriguing features of the study. The abstract
should not be composed of selected sentences from the body of the paper. Instead, the writer should sit
down and try to distil the essential elements of the work to be reported. The abstract is extremely important;
it should not be short-changed. It should be written last. This paragraph should concisely describe the
problem under investigation and the motivation for the study, the participants, the experimental method,
findings, and conclusions. You could try to write a sentence on each of these areas. To conserve characters
in the abstract, type all numbers except those that begin a sentence as digits. Avoid ending the abstract with
throw-away and uninformative statements such as ‘These results will be discussed’, or ‘how these results
relate to past theory will be discussed’.

ü Ugly (1993) has shown that the propensity to misclassify members of the opposite sex as attractive
is increased in nightclub settings. This study was designed to ascertain whether this effect is due to
the dim lighting employed in these venues, or the consumption of alcohol in this setting. Ratings of
the attractiveness of a set of stooge participants were taken in both a well-lit and dimly-lit nightclub
by both sober and drunk participants. A 2-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect of alcohol
consumption, but not of the lighting used. The results suggest that, contrary to Ugly’s hypothesis,
dim lighting does not contribute to the inflated attractiveness of opposite-gender mates; instead
these ratings are influenced solely by alcohol intake.



APey-Ape: Abstract
A good abstract is:

Accurate: it should convey the purpose and content of the study accurately. It
should cover the main areas of the report (e.g., rationale, methods, results,
implications).

Nonevaluative: report what is in the manuscript; do not evaluate it.

Coherent and readable: use verbs rather than nouns, use the active rather than the
passive voice, use the past tense to describe what was done, but the present tense
to describe results or conclusions drawn.

Concise: be brief and avoid superfluous statements/words.
“Word limits vary from journal to journal and typically range from 150 to 250 words.”
