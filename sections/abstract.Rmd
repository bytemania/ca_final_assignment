\section{Abstract}

This study examines the impact of gender on salaries in the U.S. in 1996, 
utilizing a dataset derived from census data comprising 32,561 observations. 
The dataset includes variables such as age, work classification, educational 
attainment, marital status, race, and gender, allowing for a detailed analysis 
of factors influencing income levels. Our primary objective is to identify the 
determinants that contribute to individuals earning more than $50,000 annually,
with a particular focus on gender disparities.

By applying statistical methods to analyze the data, this research aims to 
uncover patterns and relationships between demographic categories and income. 
The findings are expected to provide insights into the sociological aspects of 
wage inequality and the role gender plays within this dynamic. Furthermore, the
results will contribute to a better understanding of how different demographic
factors interact to influence economic outcomes in the United States.

The implications of this study are significant, offering a robust foundation 
for future research and policy formulation aimed at addressing wage 
disparities. By elucidating the factors that contribute to income inequality, 
particularly the impact of gender, this research helps inform strategies to
promote economic equity and fairness in the labor market.
